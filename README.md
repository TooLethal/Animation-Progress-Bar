Here’s a clean **GitHub-style project description** for the second progress bar you shared:

# 🎨 Animated Linear Progress Bar

A lightweight **HTML + CSS progress bar** that animates smoothly from start to finish, changing colors at key milestones. This version uses a single progress element with a streamlined animation sequence, making it simpler and more maintainable.

## ✨ Features
- **Responsive Layout**: Centered on the screen using Flexbox.  
- **Customizable Variables**: Easily adjust width, height, and colors via CSS variables.  
- **Color Transitions**:  
  - Start → **Red** (33%)  
  - Middle → **Blue** (66%)  
  - Finish → **Green** (100%)  
- **Smooth Animation**: Expands from 0% to 100% over 10 seconds with `ease-in` timing.  
- **Minimal Structure**: Only one `.progress-status` element inside the `.progress-bar` container.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3 (Flexbox + Keyframes)**  

## 🚀 Use Cases
- Loading indicators for websites and apps  
- Showing task completion status  
- Visualizing progress in forms, uploads, or multi-step workflows
